Abstract  O
With  O
the  O
rapid  O
development  O
of  O
Internet  O
and  O
many  O
related  O
technology,  O
Web  O
has  O
become  O
the  O
main  O
source  O
of  O
information.  O
For  O
many  O
search  O
engines,  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
different  O

in  O
the  O

the  O

As  O

Introduction  O
For  O
the  O
real  O
world,  O
many  O
people  O
share  O
one  O
name;  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
common  O
phenomenon.  O
Ac-  O
cording  O
to  O
the  O
third  O
national  O
census  O
sample  O
sur-  O
vey  O
conducted  O
by  O
the  O
State  O
Language  O
Commit-  O
tee  O
in  O
1989,  O
the  O
duplicate  O
names  O
rate  O
for  O
single  O
name  O
was  O
67.7%,  O
whereas  O
that  O
of  O
double  O
name  O
was  O
32.4%.  O
There  O
are  O
two  O
commonly  O
used  O
name  O
disam-  O
biguation  O
approach,  O
one  O
is  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
vector  O
space  O
model,  O
and  O
the  O
other  O
is  O
based  O
on  O
so-  O
cial  O
networks.  O
The  O
first  O
is  O
text-based  O
vector  O
space  O
clustering  O
approach.  O
An  O
entity  O
can  O
be  O
expressed  O
as  O
one  O
vector  O
which  O
is  O
formed  O
according  O
to  O
the  O
content  O
word  O
of  O
the  O
original  O
document.  O
And  O
then  O
the  O
si-  O
milarity  O
is  O
used  O
to  O
merge  O
documents  O
or  O
classify  O
documents.  O
The  O
second  O
method  O
is  O
based  O
on  O
social  O
net-  O
works.  O
The  O
first  O
step  O
of  O
the  O
method  O
is  O
to  O
build  O
social  O
networks,  O
by  O
analyze  O
the  O
relationship  O
of  O
different  O
people.  O
Generally  O
if  O
two  O
people’s  O
name  O
always  O
occurs  O
in  O
same  O
document  O
or  O
very  O
near  O
context  O
,they  O
will  O
have  O
close  O
relations,  O
one  O
of  O
them  O
will  O
be  O
helpful  O
for  O
disambiguate  O
the  O
other.  O
In  O
this  O
paper,  O
we  O
first  O
use  O
the  O
domain  O
of  O
cha-  O
racter’s  O
document  O
to  O
cl  O
assify  O
roughly,  O
and  O
then  O
context  O
information  O
using  O
social  O
networking  O
is  O
considered  O
again  O
to  O
disambiguate  O
person’s  O
name  O
again.  O
2  O
the  O
principle  O
of  O
our  O
system  O
Fig.1.  O
shows  O
the  O
basic  O
principle  O
of  O
our  O
system.  O
The  O
basic  O
steps  O
are:  O
Fig.1.  O
the  O
general  O
framework  O
of  O
our  O
approach  O
1）  O
documents  O
with  O
same  O
people’s  O
name  O
are  O
input;  O
2）  O
classify  O
these  O
documents  O
into  O
seven  O
ca-  O
reers  O
which  O
include  O
Cultural,  O
adminis-  O
trative,  O
military,  O
science,  O
education,  O
sports,  O
health,  O
economic  O
and  O
etc;  O
3）  O
Judge  O
if  O
the  O
people  O
are  O
reporter  O
in  O
doc-  O
ument,  O
if  O
yes;  O
separate  O
them  O
according  O
to  O
their  O
address.  O
4）  O
Separate  O
documents  O
by  O
using  O
social  O
networks.  O
This  O
is  O
because  O
different  O
people  O
usually  O
have  O
different  O
social  O
re-lations.  O
Different  O
social  O
relations  O
usual-ly  O
means  O
different  O
people  O
and  O
different  O
identity.  O
The  O
social  O
network  O
of  O
one  O
people  O
is  O
gained  O
by  O
counting  O
its  O
co-  O
occur  O
frequency  O
with  O
other  O
peoples.  O

the  O

The  O
reasons  O

the  O

ing:  O
First,  O
in  O

the  O

has  O
not  O
been  O
carried  O
out  O

the  O

dealing  O
with  O
the  O
clas-sification  O
of  O
the  O
document.  O
Some  O
of  O
them  O
are  O
not  O
the  O
people’s  O
name.  O
Second,  O
different  O
people  O
may  O
have  O

thus  O
the  O
accuracy  O
is  O
adversely  O

Summaries  O
In  O
this  O
paper,  O
we  O
utilize  O
two  O
kind  O
of  O
knowledges:  O
1)  O
people  O
always  O
have  O
his  O
own  O
career;  O
2)  O
people  O
have  O
his  O
own  O
social  O
circle.  O
We  O
think  O
these  O
in-  O
formation  O
will  O
be  O
more  O
helpful  O
for  O
disambiguation.  O
Thus  O
we  O
attempt  O
to  O
solve  O
this  O
problem  O
by  O
com-  O
bing  O
different  O
