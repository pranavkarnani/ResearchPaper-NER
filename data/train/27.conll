Abstract  O
In  O
this  O
paper  O
we  O
describe  O
our  O
participation  O
in  O
the  O
SIGHAN  O

Task-  O

and  O
detail  O
our  O
approaches.  O
Person  B-HyperparameterName

Disambiguation  I-HyperparameterName
is  O
typically  O
viewed  O
as  O
an  O
unsupervised  O
clustering  O
problem  O
where  O
the  O
aim  O
is  O
to  O
partition  O
a  O
name’s  O
contexts  O
into  O
different  O
clusters,  O
each  O
representing  O
a  O
real  O
world  O
people.  O
The  O
key  O
point  O
of  O
Clustering  O
is  O
the  O
similarity  O
measure  O
of  O
context,  O
which  O
depends  O
upon  O
the  O
features  O
selection  O
and  O
representation.  O
Two  O
clustering  O
algorithms,  O
HAC  B-HyperparameterName
and  O
DBSCAN,  B-HyperparameterName
are  O
investigated  O
in  O
our  O
system.  O
The  O
experiments  O
show  O
that  O
the  O
topic  O
features  O
learned  O
by  O
LDA  B-HyperparameterName
outperforms  O
token  O
features  O
and  O
more  O
robust.  O

Introduction  O
Most  O
current  O
web  O
searches  O
relate  O
to  O
person  O
names.  O
A  O
study  O
of  O
the  O
query  O
log  O
of  O
the  O
AllTheWeb  O
and  O
Altavista  O
search  O
sites  O
gives  O
an  O
idea  O
of  O
the  O
relevance  O
of  O
the  O
people  O
search  O
task:  O
11-17%  O
of  O
the  O
queries  O
were  O
composed  O
of  O
a  O
person  O
name  O
with  O
additional  O
terms  O
and  O
4%  O
were  O
identified  O
simply  O
as  O
person  O
names  O
(  O
Spink  O
et  O
al.,  O
2004).  O
However,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
high  O
level  O
of  O
ambiguity  O
where  O
multiple  O
individuals  O
share  O
the  O
same  O
name  O
and  O
thus  O
the  O
harvesting  O
and  O
the  O
retrieval  O
of  O
relevant  O
information  O
becomes  O
more  O
difficult.  O
This  O
ambiguity  O
has  O
recently  O
become  O
an  O
active  O
research  O
topic  O
and,  O
simultaneously,  O
a  O
relevant  O
application  O
domain  O
for  O
Web  O
search  O
services.  O
Zoominfo.com,  O
Spock.com  O
and  O
123people.com  O
are  O
examples  O
of  O
sites  O
which  O
perform  O
web  O
people  O
search,  O
although  O
with  O
limited  O
disambiguation  O
capabilities  O
(Ar  O
tiles  O
et  O
al.,  O
2009).  O
This  O
issue  O
directed  O
current  O
researchers  O
towards  O
the  O
definition  O
of  O
a  O
new  O
task  O
called  O
Web  O
People  O
Search  O
(WePS)  O
or  O
Personal  O
Name  O
Disambiguation  O
(PND).  O
The  O
key  O
assumption  O
underlying  O
the  O
task  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
context  O
surrounding  O
an  O
ambiguous  O
person  O
name  O
is  O
indicative  O
of  O
its  O
ascription.  O
The  O
goal  O
of  O
the  O
clustering  O
task  O
was  O
to  O
group  O
web  O
pages  O
containing  O
the  O
target  O
person's  O
name,  O
so  O
that  O
pages  O
referring  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
individual  O
are  O
assigned  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
cluster.  O
For  O
this  O
purpose  O
a  O
large  O
dataset  O
was  O
collected  O
and  O
manually  O
annotated.  O
Moreover,  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
ambiguity  O
in  O
word  O
segmentation  O
in  O
Chinese,  O
person  O
name  O
detection  O
is  O
necessary,  O
which  O
is  O
subtask  O
of  O
Named  O
Entity  O
Recognition  O
(NER).  O
NER  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
difficulties  O
of  O
the  O
study  O
of  O
natural  O
language  O
processing,  O
of  O
which  O
the  O
main  O
task  O
is  O
to  O
identify  O
person  O
names,  O
place  O
names,  O
organization  O
names,  O
number,  O
time  O
words,  O
money  O
and  O
other  O
entities.  O
The  O
main  O
difficulties  O
of  O
Chinese  B-HyperparameterName
person  O
name  O
entity  O
recognition  O
are  O
embodied  O
in  O
the  O
following  O
points:  O
1)  O
the  O
diversity  O
of  O
names  O
form;  O
2)  O
the  O
Chinese  O
character  O
within  O
names  O
form  O
words  O
with  O
each;  O
3)  O
names  O
and  O
their  O
context  O
form  O
words;  O
4)  O
translation  B-HyperparameterName
of  O
foreign  O
names  O
require  O
special  B-HyperparameterName
considerations.  O
In  O
this  O
paper  O
we  O
describe  O
our  O
system  O
and  O
approach  O
in  O
the  O
SIGHAN  O
2010  O
task-3  O
(Person  O
Name  O
Disambiguation).  B-HyperparameterName
A  O
novel  O
Bayesian  O
approach  O
is  O
adopt  O
in  O
our  O
system,  O
which  O
formalizes  O
the  O
disambiguation  O
problem  O
in  O
a  O
generative  O
model.  O
For  O
each  O
ambiguous  O
name  O
we  O
first  O
draw  O
a  O
distribution  O
over  O
person,  O
and  O
then  O
generate  O
context  O
words  O
according  O
to  O
this  O
distribution.  O
It  O
is  O
thus  O
assumed  O
that  O
different  O
persons  O
will  O
correspond  O
to  O
distinct  O
lexical  O
distributions.  O
In  O
this  O
framework,  O
Person  O
Name  O
Disambiguation  O
postulates  O
that  O
the  O
observed  O
data  B-HyperparameterName
(contexts)  O
are  O
explicitly  O
intended  O
to  O
communicate  O
a  O
latent  O
topic  O
distribution  O
corresponding  O
to  O
real  O
world  O
people.  O
The  O
remainder  O
of  O
this  O
paper  O
is  O
structured  O
as  O
follows.  O
We  O
first  O
present  O
an  O
overview  O
of  O
related  O
work  O
(Section  O
2)  O
and  O
then  O
describe  O
our  O
system  O
which  O
consists  O
of  O
NER  O
and  O
clustering  O
in  O
more  O
details  O
(Sections  O
3  O
and  O
4).  O
Section  O
5  O
describes  O
the  O
resources  O
and  O
evaluation  O
results  O
in  O
our  O
experiments.  O
We  O
discuss  O
our  O
results  O
and  O
conclude  O
our  O
work  O
in  O
Section  O

2  O
Related  O
Work  O
The  O
most  O
commonly  O
used  O
feature  O
is  O
the  O
bag  O
of  O
words  O
in  O
local  O
or  O
global  O
context  O
of  O
the  O
ambiguous  O
name  O
(Ikeda  O
et  O
al.,  O
2009;  O
Romano  O
et  O
al.,  O
2009).  O
Because  O
the  O
given  O
corpus  O
is  O
often  O
not  O
large  O
enough  O
to  O
learn  O
the  O
realistic  O
probabilities  O
or  O
weights  B-HyperparameterName
for  O
those  O
features,  O
traditional  O
algorithm  O
such  O
as  O
vector-based  O
techniques  O
used  O
in  O
large-scale  O
text  O
will  O
lead  O
to  O
data  O
sparseness.  O
In  O
recent  O
years,  O
more  O
and  O
more  O
important  O
studies  O
have  O
attempted  O
to  O
overcome  O
the  O
problem  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
better  O
(semantic)  O
similarity  O
measures.  O
A  O
lot  O
of  O
features  O
such  O
as  O
syntactic  O
chunks,  O
named  B-HyperparameterName
entities,  B-HyperparameterName
dependency  O
parses,  O
semantic  O
role  O
labels,etc.,  O
were  O
employed.  O
However,  O
these  O
features  O
need  O
many  O
NLP  O
preprocessing  O
(Chen,  O
2009).  O
Many  O
studies  O
show  O
that  O
they  O
can  O
achieve  O
state-  B-HyperparameterName
of-the-art  O
performances  O
only  O
with  O
lightweight  O
features.  O

Another  O

shows  O
that  O

can  O
deliver  O
excellent  O
performance  O
if  O

The  O

is  O
still  O
in  O
its  O
infancy.  O
Person  O

in  O
Chinese.  O
At  O
present,  O
the  O
main  O

of  O

is  O
used  O
statistical  O
models,  O
and  O
the  O
hybrid  O
approach.  O
Liu  O
et  O

(2000)  O
designed  O
a  O
Chinese  O
person  O

based  O
on  O
statistical  O
methods,  O
using  O
samples  O

from  O
the  O

and  O
the  O
real  O
amount  O
of  O
statistical  O
data  O
to  O
improve  O
the  O
system  O
performance,  O
while  O
the  O
shortcoming  O
is  O
that  O
samples  O
of  O
name  O

are  O
too  O
small,  O
resulting  O
in  O
low  O
recall.  O
Li  O

(2006)  O
use  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O

and  O
local  O

to  O
recognize  O

the  O

is  O
to  O
use  O

we  O

on  O
Conditional  B-HyperparameterName
Random  I-HyperparameterName
Fields  I-HyperparameterName
(CRFs)  I-HyperparameterName
algorithm  O
to  O
establish  O
the  O

Given  O
of  O
the  O
input  O
text,  O
we  O
may  O
detect  O
the  O
potential  O
person  O
names  O
in  O
the  O
text  O
fragments,  O
and  O
then  O
take  O
various  O
features  O
into  O
account  O
to  O
recognize  O

Conditional  B-HyperparameterName
Random  I-HyperparameterName

as  O
a  O
sequence  O
learning  O
method  O
has  O
been  O
successfully  O
applied  O
in  O
many  O
NLP  O
tasks.  O
More  O
details  O
of  O
the  O
its  O
principle  O
can  O
be  O
referred  O
in  O
(Lafferty,  O
McCallum,  O
and  O
Pereira,  O
2001;  O
Wallach,  O
2004).  O
We  O
here  O
will  O
focus  O
on  O
how  O
to  O
apply  O
CRFs  B-HyperparameterName
in  O
our  O
person  B-HyperparameterName
name  I-HyperparameterName
recognition  I-HyperparameterName
task.  O
3.1  O
CRFs-based  O
name  O
recognition  O
CRFs  B-HyperparameterName
is  O
used  O
to  O
get  O
potential  O
names  O
as  O
the  O
first  O
stage  O
name  O
recognition  O
outcome.  O
To  O
avoid  O
the  O
interference  O
that  O
caused  O
by  O
word  O
segmentation  O
errors,  O
we  O
use  O
single  O
Chinese  O
character  O
information  O
rather  O
than  O
word  O
as  O
discriminative  O
features  O
for  O
CRFs  B-HyperparameterName
learning  O
model.  O
We  O
use  O
BIEO  O
label  O
strategy  O
to  O
transfer  O
the  O
name  O
recognition  O
as  O
a  O
sequence  O
learning  O
task.  O
The  O
label  O
set  O
includes:  O
B-Nr  O
(Begin,  O
the  O
initial  O
character  O
of  O
name),  O
I-Nr  O
(In,  O
the  O
middle  O
character  O
of  O
name),  O
E-Nr(End,  O
the  O
end  O
character  O
of  O
name)  O
and  O
O  O
(Other,  O
other  O
characters  O
that  O
aren’t  O
name).  O
3.2  O
Rule-based  O
Correction  O
After  O
labeling  O
the  O
potential  O
names  O
by  O
CRFs  O
model,  O
we  O
apply  O
a  O
set  O
of  O
rules  O
to  O
boost  O
recognition  O
result,  O
which  O
has  O
been  O
proved  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
key  O
to  O
improve  O
Chinese  O
name  O
recognition.  O
The  O
error  O
of  O
the  O
potential  O
names  O
outcome  O
by  O
CRFs  O
model  O
is  O
mainly  O
divided  O
into  O
the  O
following  O
categories:  O
the  O
initial  O
character  O
of  O
name  O
is  O
not  O
recognized,  O
the  O
middle  O
character  O
of  O
name  O
is  O
not  O
recognized,  O
the  O
end  O
character  O
of  O
name  O
is  O
not  O
recognized,  O
and  O
their  O
combinations  O
of  O
those  O
three  O
errors.  O
The  O
other  O
two  O
extreme  O
errors,  O
including  O
non-name  O
recognition  O
for  O
the  O
anchor  O
name,  O
and  O
the  O
name  O
is  O
not  O
recognized  O
as  O
potential  O
names.  O
In  O
the  O
stage  O
of  O
rule-based  O
correction,  O
we  O
first  O
conduct  O
word  O
segmentation  O
for  O
the  O
text.  O
The  O
segmentation  O
process  O
is  O
also  O
realized  O
with  O
the  O
method  O
of  O
CRFs,  O
without  O
using  O
dictionaries  O
and  O
other  O
external  O
knowledge.  O
The  O
detailed  O
description  O
is  O
beyond  O
this  O
paper,  O
which  O
can  O
be  O
accessible  O
in  O
the  O
paper  O
(Lafferty,  O
McCallum,  O
and  O
Pereira,  O
2001).  O
The  O
only  O
thing  O
we  O
should  O
note  O
is  O
that  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
error  O
in  O
such  O
segmentation  O
result  O
obtained  O
in  O
this  O
way  O
can  O
be  O
corrected  O
through  O
the  O
introduction  O
of  O
an  O
external  O
dictionary.  O
For  O
each  O
potential  O
name,  O
and  O
we  O
examine  O
it  O
from  O
the  O
following  O
two  O
aspects:  O
1)  O
It  O
is  O
reasonable  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
word  O
in  O
a  O
person  O
name,  O
including  O
checking  O
the  O
surname  O
and  O
the  O
character  O
used  O
in  O
names;  O
2)  O
The  O
left  O
and  O
right  O
borders  O
are  O
correct.  O
Check  O
the  O
left  O
and  O
right  O
sides  O
of  O
the  O
cutting  O
unit  O
can  O
be  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
names,  O
including  O
the  O
words  O

The  O

we  O
used  O
can  O
be  O
divided  O
into  O
two  O
types,  O
one  O
is  O

features,  O
including  O

the  O

Token-based  O
Features  O
Simple  O
token-based  O
features  O
are  O
used  O
in  O
almost  O
every  O
disambiguation  O
system.  O
Here,  O
we  O
extract  O
three  O
kinds  O
of  O
tokens:  O
words,  O
uni-char  O
and  O
bi-char  O
occurring  O
in  O
a  O
given  O
document.  O
Then,  O
each  O
token  O
in  O
each  O

is  O
weighed  O
by  O
using  O
a  O

Features  O
Selection  O
In  O
this  O
Section,  O
we  O
give  O
a  O
brief  O
introduction  O
on  O
two  O
effective  O
unsupervised  O
feature  O
selection  O
methods,  O
DF  O
and  O
global  O
tf-idf.  O
DF  O
(Document  O
frequency)  O
is  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
documents  O
in  O
which  O
a  O
term  O
occurs  O
in  O
a  O
dataset.  O
It  O
is  O
the  O
simplest  O
criterion  O
for  O
term  O
selection  O
and  O
easily  O
scales  O
to  O
a  O
large  O
dataset  O
with  O
linear  O
computation  O
complexity.  O
It  O
is  O
a  O
simple  O
but  O
effective  O
feature  O
selection  O
method  O
for  O
text  O
categorization  O
(Yang  O
&  O
Pedersen,  O
1997).We  O
introduce  O
a  O
new  O
feature  O
selection  O
method  O
called  O
“global  O
tf-idf”  O
that  O
takes  O
the  O
term  O
weight  O
into  O
account.  O
Because  O
DF  O
assumes  O
that  O
each  O
term  O
is  O
of  O
same  O
importance  O
in  O
different  O
documents,  O
it  O
is  O
easily  O
biased  O
by  O
those  O
common  O
terms  O
which  O
have  O
high  O
document  O
frequency  O
but  O
uniform  O
distribution  O
over  O
different  O
classes.  O
Global  O
tf-idf  O
is  O
proposed  O
to  O
deal  O

only  O

they  O

We  O

between  O

which  O
based  O
on  O

In  O

a  O

Since  O
the  O

for  O
the  O

system  O
is  O
very  O
important,  O
we  O
focus  O
only  O
on  O
the  O
B-cubed  B-MetricName

(Artiles  O

acquire  O

then  O
use  O

In  O

we  O
report  O
our  O

by  O
the  O

As  O
shown  O
in  O
Table  O

DBSCAN  O
isn’t  O
suitable  O
for  O
this  O
task,  O
and  O
the  O
results  O
are  O
very  O
sensitive  O
to  O
parameters.  O
So  O
we  O
didn’t  O
submit  O
DBSCAN-  O
based  O
results.  O
Table  O

shows  O
that  O
the  O
best  O
averaged  O
F-scores  B-HyperparameterName
for  O
PND  O
are  O
based  O
on  O
topic  O
model,  O
which  O
meet  O
our  O
initial  O
assumptions,  O
and  O
result  O
based  O
on  O
merging  O
local  O
and  O
global  O
information  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
better  O
than  O
both  O
local  O
and  O
global  O
information  O
independently.  O
Also,  O
the  O
results  O
based  O
on  O
topic  O
model  O
are  O
the  O
most  O
robust  O
because  O
the  O
F-score  B-HyperparameterName
of  O
variation  O
is  O
slightly  O
with  O
stop-threshold  O
changing.  O
Conversely,  O
the  O
results  O
based  O
on  O
token  O
are  O
not  O
like  O
this.  O
As  O
the  O
performance  O
of  O
segmentation  O
is  O
not  O
very  O
satisfactory,  O
results  O
based  O
on  O
word  O
are  O
worst,  O
even  O
worse  O
than  O
uni-char-based.  O
In  O
addition,  O
it  O
is  O
found  O
that  O
global  O
tf-idf  O
is  O
better  O
than  O
DF,  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
simplest  O

method.  O
Entropy  O

is  O
more  O
effective  O
than  O

However,  O
in  O
our  O

only  O

is  O
exploited.  O
We  O
are  O
going  O
to  O
collect  O
a  O

large  O

as  O
universal  O

to  O
train  O

then  O
do  O

a  O

and  O
a  O
rich  O
set  O
of  O

discovered  O
from  O

The  O

can  O
be  O

Wikipedia  O
queried  O
by  O
target  O

some  O

so  O
on.  O
We  O
built  O
our  O
PDN  O
system  O
on  O
the  O

of  O

However,  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
appropriate  O
to  O
toally  O
trust  O
the  O

So  O
an  O
algorithm  O
that  O
can  O
correct  O

should  O
be  O
investigated  O
in  O
future  O

Moreover,  O

can  O
ensure  O
the  O
