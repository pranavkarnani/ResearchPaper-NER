This  O

of  O
our  O

in  O
the  O

.  O
We  O
propose  O
a  O
system  O
which  O
uses  O
a  O
HAC  B-MethodName
algorithm  O
to  O
cluster  O
the  O

Introduction  O
Personal  B-TaskName
name  I-TaskName
disambiguation  I-TaskName
is  O
actually  O
a  O
task  O
to  O
group  O
those  O
documents  O
according  O
to  O
whether  O
the  O
given  O
personal  O
name  O
appearing  O
in  O
that  O
document  O
refers  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
person  O
in  O
reality.  O
It  O
become  O
s  O
an  O
active  O
research  O
topic  O
recently  O
,  O
and  O
the  O
evaluation  O
campaign  O
for  O
the  O
English  O
personal  O
name  O
has  O
been  O
held  O
twice.  O
Chinese  O
personal  B-TaskName
name  I-TaskName
disambiguation  I-TaskName
is  O
thought  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
challenging  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
need  O
for  O
word  O
segmentation  O
which  O
coul  O
d  O
bring  O
e  O
rrors  O
into  O
the  O
subsequent  O
processes.  O
The  O
most  O
widely  O
used  O
method  O
for  O
perso  B-TaskName
nal  I-TaskName
name  I-TaskName
disambiguation  I-TaskName
is  O
unsupervised  O
clustering,  O
we  O
adopt  O
a  O
Hierarchical  B-MethodName
Agglomerative  I-MethodName
Clustering  I-MethodName
algorithm  O
in  O
our  O
system  O
,  O
which  O
is  O
also  O
the  O
most  O
popular  O
clustering  O
algor  O
ithm  O
used  O
by  O
the  O
teams  O
of  O
the  O
second  O

Evaluation  O
campaign.  O
The  O
remaining  O
part  O
of  O
this  O
report  O
is  O
organized  O
as  O
follows  O
.  O
Section  O

.  O
The  O

request  O
s  O
two  O
different  O

s,  O
a  O
formal  O
test,  O
and  O
a  O

we  O
will  O
discuss  O
the  O

Document  O
preprocessing  O
Different  O
from  O
the  O
document  O
pre  O
processing  O
for  O
English,  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
use  O
a  O
segmentation  O
tool  O
and  O
a  O
part  O
-of-speech  O
tagger  O
to  O
do  O
some  O
preprocessing  O
work  O
.  O
For  O
e  O
xample,  O
without  O
the  O
segment  O
ing  O
process  O
,  O
the  O
document  O
s  O
only  O
contain  O
the  O
string  O
“最高军事法院  O
”  O
could  O
be  O
clustered  O
when  O
the  O
query  O
name  O
is  O
“高军  O
”,  O
and  O
we  O
need  O
the  O
part  O
-of-speech  O
tagger  O
to  O
detect  O
whether  O
the  O
C  O
hinese  O
word  O
“黄海  O
”  O
stands  O
for  O
a  O
personal  O
name  O
or  O
a  O
toponym  O
.  O
Our  O
experiments  O
prove  O
that  O
the  O
system  O
is  O
sensitive  O
to  O
the  O
tools  O
’  O
performance,  O
the  O
different  O
result  O
between  O
the  O
formal  O
test  O
and  O
the  O
diagnosis  O
test  O
also  O
proves  O
this.  O
These  O
tools  O
are  O
trained  O
with  O
the  O
90%  O
data  O
of  O
The  O
People's  B-DatasetName
Daily  I-DatasetName
published  O
in  O
Jan.1998,and  O
tested  O
with  O
the  O
others  O
10%  O
data.  O
The  O
performances  O
of  O
the  O
tools  O
are：  O

Extract  O
ed  O
feature  O
s  O
As  O
mentioned  O
previously,  O
our  O
goal  O
is  O
to  O
group  O
those  O
documents.  O
In  O
our  O
approach  O
,  O
each  O
document  O
is  O
represented  O
by  O
a  O
vector  O
of  O
features  O
extracted  O
from  O
it  O
automatically.  O
We  O
use  O
three  O
kinds  O
of  O
token  O
-based  O
feature  O
s:  O
1)  O
Nouns  O
occur  O
around  O
the  O
ambiguous  O
personal  O
name  O
.  O
This  O
kind  O
of  O
features  O
is  O
selected  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
idea  O
that  O
words  O
around  O
the  O
ambiguous  O
personal  O
name  O
are  O
more  O
relevant  O
to  O
it,  O
a  O
nd  O
Nouns  O
can  O
provide  O
a  O
more  O
diagnostic  O
description  O
of  O
the  O
person.  O
We  O
use  O
a  O
window  O
to  O
select  O
the  O
nouns.  O
2)  O
Personal  O
names  O
(except  O
the  O
ambiguous  O
personal  O
name)  O
and  O
toponyms  O
occur  O
in  O
the  O
document  O
.  O
It  O
is  O
intuitive  O
that  O
the  O
identical  O
person  O
often  O
associated  O
with  O
the  O
same  O
personal  O
names  O
and  O
toponyms.  O
3)  O
Words  O
with  O
high  O
TFIDF  O
value  O
.  O
In  O
our  O
final  O
system,  O
we  O
use  O
the  O
ten  O
words  O
with  O
highest  O
TFIDF  O
value.  O
This  O
kind  O
of  O
features  O
can  O
reflect  O
the  O
theme  O
of  O
an  O
article,  O
an  O
identical  O
person  O
often  O
be  O
mentioned  O
in  O
article  O
s  O
with  O
the  O
same  O
theme  O
.  O
Using  O
these  O
features  O
simultaneously  O
can  O
alleviate  O
the  O
problem  O
caused  O
by  O
spare  O
data.  O
The  O
following  O
table  O
presents  O
a  O
quantitative  O
analysis:  O
used  O
features  O
highest  O
F  O
score  O
on  O
dev  O
of  O
features  O
These  O
r  O
esults  O
are  O
obtained  O
by  O
using  O
a  O
initial  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
preprocessing  O
toools,  O
and  O
when  O
we  O
improve  O
the  O
performances  O
of  O
the  O
tools,  O
the  O
highest  O
F  O
s  O
core  B-MetricName
increas  O
es  O
from  O
86.76  O
to  O
89.61  O
.  O
The  O
similarity  O
between  O
documents  O
was  O
measured  O
with  O
the  O
cosine  O
of  O
feature  O
vectors.  O
When  O
comput  O
ing  O
the  O
similarity  O
between  O
two  O
documents,  O
we  O
proposed  O
a  O
weight  O
ing  O
method  O
for  O
the  O
feature  O
s  O
as:  O
If  O
the  O
token  O
occurs  O
in  O
the  O
document,  O
the  O
weight  O
will  O
be  O
1,  O
else  O
0.  O
We  O
have  O
tried  O
anoth  O
er  O
method  O
that  O
count  O
the  O
tokens  O
’  O
weight  O
by  O
its  O
frequency  O
,  O
but  O
experiments  O
prove  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
less  O
effective  O
one,  O
we  O
can  O
interpret  O
it  O
by  O
this  O
example  O
:  O
If  O
a  O
word  O
"  O
教授  O
"  O
which  O
refers  O
to  O
a  O
person  O
named  O
"  O
李  O
明  O
"  O
appears  O
twice  O
in  O
one  O
document  O
while  O
three  O
times  O
in  O
another  O
document,  O
these  O
two  O
documents  O
are  O
very  O
likely  O
referring  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
pe  O
rson,  O
but  O
the  O
latter  O
weighting  O
method  O
decreases  O
the  O
similarity  O
between  O
them  O
.  O

Clustering  O
algorithm  O
A  O
Hierarchical  B-MethodName
Agglomerative  I-MethodName
Clustering  I-MethodName
algorithm  O
is  O
adopted  O
in  O
our  O
system,  O
which  O
determines  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
the  O
cluster  O
by  O
a  O
fixed  O
similarity  O
threshold  O
learned  O
from  O
the  O
train  O
data  O
.  O
At  O
each  O
stage  O
of  O
the  O
clustering,  O
the  O
two  O
most  O
simila  O
r  O
cluster  O
s  O
are  O
merged  O
into  O
a  O
new  O
one,  O
and  O
other  O
clusters  O
’  O
similarit  O
ies  O
with  O
the  O
new  O
cluster  O
is  O
the  O
larger  O
one  O
of  O
their  O
similarit  O
ies  O
with  O
the  O
two  O
old  O
cluster  O
s.  O
We  O
have  O
tried  O
some  O
other  O
clustering  O
method  O
s  O
such  O
as  O
modified  O
k  O
-means  O
clustering  O
with  O
the  O
same  O
fea  O
tures,  O
but  O
the  O
performances  O
are  O
worse.  O
A  O
pre-judgment  O
stage  O
before  O
clustering  O
is  O
useful  O
in  O
the  O
experiment,  O
which  O
can  O
be  O
done  O
as  O
follow:  O
If  O
two  O
documents  O
have  O
the  O
same  O
triple  O
tokens  O
“token1  O
token2  O
PersonName  O
”  O
(token2  O
is  O
tagged  O
as  O
noun),  O
then  O
they  O
are  O
classi  O
fied  O
to  O
one  O
cluster.  O

Result  O
and  O
discussion  O
The  O
difference  O
between  O
the  O
formal  O
test  O
and  O
the  O
diagnosis  O
test  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
ambiguous  O
personal  O
name  O
in  O
each  O
doc  O
ument  O
have  O
been  O
told  O
in  O
the  O
latter  O
,  O
but  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
find  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
former  O
by  O
you  O
rself.  O

the  O
ambiguous  O

name  O
in  O
the  O
formal  O

is  O
to  O
