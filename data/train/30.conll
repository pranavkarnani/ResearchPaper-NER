Introduction O
The O
COVID-19 O
pandemic O
has O
affected O
millions O
of O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world. O
Despite O
the O
grow- O
ing O
knowledge O
of O
COVID-19, O
much O
still O
remains O
unclear, O
especially O
potential O
long-term O
health O
con- O
sequences. O
The O
term O
of O
Long O
COVID O
was O
brought O
up O
by O
the O
patients O
on O
Twitter O
in O
May O
2020, O
in O
order O
to O
express O
their O
long-term O
COVID O
illness O
(Callard O
and O
Perego, O
2021). O
Many O
Long O
COVID O
sufferers O
shared O
their O
persistent O
symptoms O
on O
social O
media O
bringing O
nu- O
merous O
discussions O
of O
similar O
symptoms O
experi- O
enced O
by O
others. O
Long O
COVID, O
also O
known O
as O
post O
COVID-19 O
syndrome, O
has O
no O
strict O
definition. O
The O
CDC O
of O
the O
United O
States1describes O
Long O
COVID O
as O

Though O
the O

expe- O
rience O
mild O

with O
no O
necessity O
of O
hos- O
pitalization, O
the O
post-COVID O

is O
being O
reported O
by O
not O
just O

There- O
fore, O
massive O
user-generated O
Long O
COVID O
data O
available O
on O
social O

has O
a O
significant O
value O
for O

and O
analyzing O
the O
long-term O

Thus, O
in O
this O
work, O
we O
aim O
to O
apply O
Natural O

By O
extracting O
and O
analyzing O
key O

from O
Long O
COVID-related O
tweets, O
we O
can O
discover O
less O

Moreover, O
we O
also O
seek O
to O
study O
the O

To O

Fig. O

using O
a O
synthetic O
tweet O
based O
on O
several O
real O
tweets O
as O
an O
example. O
First, O
noun O
phrases O
(NPs) O
are O
iden- O
tified O
in O
each O
tweet O
and O
then O
classified O
to O
different O
categories. O
Next, O
Long O
COVID-related O
informa- O
tion O
is O
extracted O
from O
the O
identified O
NPs O
for O
further O
analysis. O
3.1 O
Noun B-TaskName
Phrase I-TaskName
Classification I-TaskName
We O
extract O
relevant O
information O
from O
tweets O
by O
identifying O
NPs O
from O
seven O
categories, O
as O
shown O
in O
Table O
1. O
As O
observed, O
some O
NPs O
may O
carry O
more O
than O
one O
information O
category. O
For O
example, O
"my O
31 O
year O
old O
daughter" O
contains O
’age’, O
and O
’gen- O
der.’ O
As O
such, O
we O
regard O
the O
NPs O
classification O
as O
a O
multi-label O
and O
multi-class O
classification O
task. O
Af- O
ter O
manually O
labeling O
some O
data, O
we O
aim O
to O
train O
a O
supervised O
classification O
model. O
In O
this O
work, O
we O
evaluate O
and O
compare O
the O
following O
NP O
classifica- O
tion O
models: O
(a) O
Support B-MethodName
vector I-MethodName
machine I-MethodName

(Devlin O
et O
al., O
2019). O
The O
most O
accurate O
model O
is O
selected O
for O
this O
stage. O
3.2 O
Information O
Extraction O
After O
identifying O
NPs O
implicating O
valuable O
infor- O
mation, O
we O
process O
and O
extract O
information O
from O
these O
NPs O
for O
further O
analysis. O
Symptom O
Categorization O
At O
this O
stage, O
we O
try O
to O
identify O
symptom-related O
NPs. O
The O
symptom O
classification O
task O
needs O
to O
capture O
the O
synonyms O
for O
each O
symptom O
category. O
Because O
text O
on O
Twit- O
ter O
is O
informal, O
the O
symptoms O
are O
not O
named O
in O
a O
consistent O
or O
complete O
way. O
We O
chose O
to O
overcome O
this O
problem O
using O
BERT B-MethodName
embeddings. O
BERT B-MethodName
is O
not O
only O
capable O
of O
providing O
similar O
embeddings O
for O
close O
meanings, O
it O
also O
gives O
contextualised O
em- O
beddings. O
Additionally, O
as O
a O
Masked O
Language O
Model, O
BERT B-MethodName
produces O
significant O
results O
in O
under- O
standing O
an O
incomplete O
text. O
Therefore, O
we O
built O
the O
classification O
model O
by O
fine-tuning O
BERT B-MethodName
to O
identify O
all O
the O
symptom-related O
NPs. O
Gender O
Extraction O
We O
label O
NPs O
as O
"Gender" O
if O
they O
include O
gender O
information O
about O
the O
reported O
person, O
such O
as, O
"my O
daughter", O
"my O
husband". O
Also, O
some O
self-reported O
tweets O
mention O
the O
gender O
explicitly. O
We O
extract O
the O
patient O
gender O
("male" O
or O
"female") O
from O
the O
relevant O
NPs O
by O
conducting O
binary O
classification. O
Symptom O
Duration O
Calculation O
Considering O
the O
different O
definitions O
for O
Long O
COVID, O
we O
chose O
to O
use O
’week’ O
to O
measure O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
symp- O
toms. O
It O
is O
observed O
that O
the O
users O
may O
report O
the O
time O
period O
of O
their O
Long O
COVID O
symptoms O
or O
the O
date O
of O
diagnosis, O
both O
of O
which O
can O
provide O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
symptoms. O
Therefore, O
we O
extract O
the O
symptom O
duration O
from O
NPs O
labeled O
as O
"Time" O
or O
"Date". O
The O
NPs O
classified O
as O
"Time", O
which O
are O
representing O
the O
time O
period, O
are O
converted O
into O
weeks O
directly. O
As O
for O
the O
NPs O
of O
"Date" O
category, O
which O
are O
expressing O
the O
date O
of O
the O
reported O
diag- O
nosis, O
the O
duration O
is O
calculated O
by O
subtracting O
the O
creation O
date O
of O
the O
tweets. O
Age O
Extraction O
The O
user O
age O
in O
years O
is O
extracted O
from O
the O
NPs O
assigned O
to O
the O
"Age" O
category O
by O
converting O
number O
text O
to O
integers O
and O
extracting O
the O
integers. O
Any O
extracted O
values O
that O
are O
out O
of O
age O
range O
([0,100]) O
are O
then O
filtered O
out.Location O
Process O
The O
geolocation O
information O
considers O
"Location" O
NPs O
and O
the O
reported O
loca- O
tions O
in O
account O
profiles. O
However, O
if O
the O
geolo- O
cation O
information O
retrieved O
from O
the O
NP O
and O
the O
account O
profile O
are O
nonidentical O
for O
a O
single O
tweet, O
we O
keep O
the O
geolocation O
information O
from O
the O

Later, O
the O
location O

is O
converted O
into O
coordinates. O
3.3 O
Data O
Analysis O
In O
this O
work, O
we O
conduct O
analysis O
of O
three O
cate- O
gories: O
demographic O
analysis, O
geographical O
analy- O
sis, O
and O
textual O
content O
analysis. O
Demographic O
Analysis O
We O
analyze O
the O
distri- O

of O
the O
reported O
symptoms. O
Aligning O
the O
creation O
date O
of O
the O
tweets O
and O
the O
mentioned O
symp- O
toms, O
we O
explore O
how O
the O
symptom O
distributions O
evolve O
through O
the O
timeline. O
To O
explore O
the O
associa- O
tions O
of O
other O
features O
with O
symptoms, O
we O
associate O
the O
extracted O
information O
with O
the O
symptoms O
men- O
tioned O
in O
the O
same O
tweet. O
Associated O
with O
gender O
information, O
we O
analyze O
the O
gender O
distribution O
of O
symptoms, O
to O
compare O
the O
symptoms O
experienced O
by O
men O
and O
women. O
Associated O
with O
gender O
and O
age/duration, O
we O
also O
present O
the O
joint O
distributions O
of O
gender, O
age/duration O
and O
several O
major O
symp- O
toms O
respectively. O
The O
average O
age O
and O
duration O
of O
each O
symptom O
are O
calculated O
and O
demonstrated. O
Geographical O
Analysis O
We O
visualize O
the O
loca- O
tions O
on O
a O
global O
map, O
marked O
for O
different O
symp- O
toms. O
The O
distribution O
of O
each O
symptom O
can O
be O
clearly O
seen O
on O
the O
map, O
providing O
a O
geographical O
perspective. O
Textual O
Content O
Analysis O
To O
drill O
down O
into O
the O
tweets O
content, O
we O
generate O
a O
word O
cloud O
for O
the O
data O
of O
each O
month. O
The O
word O
cloud O
presents O
the O
most O
frequent O
words O
related O
to O
symptoms. O
Word O
cloud O
could O
enable O
to O
discover O
new O
symptoms O
and O
the O
interaction O
of O
several O
different O
symptoms. O
We O
use O
word O
distance O
with O
symptom O
words O
to O
filter O
out O
the O
frequent O
words O
that O
are O
irrelevant O
to O
Long O
COVID. O
Each O
word O
is O
represented O
by O
a O
word2vec B-MethodName
vector. I-MethodName
For O
each O
word, O
we O
calculate O
the O
distance O
to O
each O
vector O
in O
the O
symptom O
list, O
then O
keep O
the O
closest O
distance O
as O
the O
score O
for O
this O
word. O
Later, O
we O
sort O
these O
words O
by O
their O

from O
closest O
to O

Some O

the O

we O
can O

that O
the O

Most O

It O

be O
considered O
that O

In O

the O

some O

Discussion O
Some O
important O
insights O
can O
be O
gained O
from O
the O
analysis. O
For O
example, O
women O
tend O
to O
experience O
Long O
COVID O
more O
frequently O
than O
men, O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
findings O
of O
some O
medical O
stud- O
ies O
(Sudre O
et O
al., O
2021; O
Ortona O
and O
Malorni, O
2021; O
Bai O
et O
al., O
2021; O
Blomberg O
et O
al., O
2021). O
Addition- O
ally, O
’mental O
problems’ O
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
symptoms O
shown O
in O
our O
results, O
which O
is O
rarely O
mentioned O
as O
a O
common O
symptom O
in O
other O
works. O
In O
our O
work, O
’mental O
problems’ O
refers O
to O
depression, O
anxi- O
ety, O
loneliness O
and O
other O
mental O
or O
emotional O
health O
issues. O
Similarly, O
Sarker O
and O
Ge O
(2021) O
reported O
55.2% O
users O
in O
the O
Reddit O
dataset O
experiencing O
mental O
problems O
since O
their O
COVID O
onset. O

Conclusions O
In O
this O
work, O
we O
conducted O
a O
comprehensive O
anal- O
ysis O
of O
Long O
COVID O
symptoms O
reported O
by O
the O
Twitter O
users O
with O
respect O
to O
their O
demographic O
and O
geographical O
characteristics. O
The O
presented O
case O
study O
provides O
detailed O
information O
and O
important O
insights O
about O
multiple O
aspects O
of O
long-term O
symp- O
toms. O
The O
comparative O
analysis O
of O
two O
periods O
of O
time O
(in O
2020 O
and O
2021) O
shows O
the O
consistent O
and O
the O
evolving O
characteristics O
of O
the O
Long O
COVID. O
Furthermore, O
an O
interactive O
online O
dashboard O
was O
built O
to O
visualize O
the O
results O
of O
the O
2020 O
dataset. O
Limitations O
of O
this O
work O
include O
the O
possible O
effect O
of O
large O
amounts O
of O
noise O
in O
the O
Twitter O
data O
on O
our O
results. O
Besides, O
the O
data O
analyzed O
was O
limited O
to O
English O
tweets, O
which O
might O
not O
be O
representative O
of O
all O
segments O
of O
the O
world O
population O
affected O
by O
COVID-19. O
Thus, O
our O
future O
work O
will O
focus O
on O
analyzing O
larger O
amounts O
of O
data O
in O
multiple O
languages. O
Symptoms O
co-occurrence O
and O
presence O
of O
comorbidities O
may O
also O
be O
explored O
in O
the O
future O
work. O
Moreover, O
non-binary O
gender O
class O
may O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
in O
the O
future O
work O
as O
well.17Ethics O
