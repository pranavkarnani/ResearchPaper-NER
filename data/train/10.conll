We O
combine O
the O

to O
identify O
several O
types O

We O
show O
that O

we O
can O
double O

Introduction O
Functional O
expressions O
are O
one O
of O
the O
most O
im- O
portant O
elements O
of O
Japanese O
grammar O
that O
any- O
one O
studying O
the O
language O
must O
learn. O
Despite O
the O
importance O
of O
functional O
expressions, O
many O
tools O
that O
assist O
learners O
of O
Japanese O
with O
reading O
texts O
only O
provide O
dictionary O
look-up O
of O
simple O
words. O
However, O
the O
ability O
to O
quickly O
obtain O
informa- O
tion O
about O
such O
grammar O
could O
not O
only O
improve O
the O
learner’s O
comprehension O
of O
the O
text, O
but O
also O
facilitate O
their O
learning O
process O
of O
new O
elements O
of O
Japanese O
grammar. O
Thus, O
we O
have O
decided O
to O
develop O
a O
Japanese O
reading O
assistant O
that O
is O
ca- O
pable O
of O
providing O
explanations O
of O
functional O
ex- O
pressions O
in O
addition O
to O
vocabulary. O
Functional O
expressions O
in O
Japanese O
are O
com- O
pound O
expressions O
that O
contain O
content O
and O
func- O
tion O
words, O
and O
can O
have O
both O
compositional O
and O
non-compositional O
meanings. O
For O
example, O
in O
Ta- O
ble O
1, O
sentences O
1 O
and O
2 O
contain O
the O
ʹ͋ͨΓ O
(ni- O
atari) O
compound O
expression. O
In O
sentence O
1, O
this O
expression O
has O
a O
functional, O
non-compositional O
meaning O
of O
“when.” O
However, O
in O
sentence O
2, O
thesame O
expression O
has O
a O
compositional O
meaning O
that O
results O
simply O
from O
using O
the O
post-particle O
ʹ(ni) O
and O
verb O
͋ͨΓ O
(a O
conjugated O
form O
of O
͋ͨΔ O
(ataru), O
meaning O
“to O
hit”) O
together. O
We O
refer O
to O
this O
as O
the O
content O
usage O
of O
a O
functional O
expres- O
sion. O
However, O
there O
are O
also O
functional O
expres- O
sions O
where O
this O
type O
of O
content O
usage O
is O
very O
rare O
(or O
even O
nonexistent). O
Sentence O
3 O
shows O
an O
ex- O
ample O
of O
the O
ͳ͚Ε͹ͳΓ·ͤΜ O
(nakerebanari- O
masen) O
functional O
expression O
which O
has O
a O
very O
common O
functional O
meaning O
of O
“must O
or O
have O
to.” O
Tsuchiya O
et O
al. O
(2006) O
have O
proposed O
a O
method O
based O
on O
machine O
learning O
to O
identify B-TaskName
functional I-TaskName
expressions. I-TaskName
However, O
this O
method O
only O
covers O
functional O
expressions O
which O
have O
balanced O
func- O
tional O
vs. O
content O
usage O
ratios. O
In O
order O
to O
boost O
coverage B-MetricName
of O
current O
methods, O
we O
propose O
a O
hybrid O
approach O
for O
functional B-TaskName
expression I-TaskName
identiﬁcation I-TaskName
which O
uses O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
machine O
learning O
method O
proposed O
by O
Tsuchiya O
et O
al. O
(2006) O
and O
simple O
patterns. O
Coverage B-MetricName
analysis O
and O
empirical O
evaluations O
show O
that O
our O
method O
doubles O
the O
cov- B-MetricName
erage I-MetricName
of O
previous O
approaches O
while O
still O
maintain- O
ing O
a O
high O
level O
of O
performance. O

included O
work O
on O

methods O
as O
well O
as O
resources O
that O
aid O
identiﬁcation. O
Matsuyoshi O
et O
al. O
(2006) O
developed O
a O
hierarchical O
dictionary O
of O
functional O
expressions O
called O
Tsutsuji. O
The O
top O
level O
of O
the O
dictionary’s O
nine O
level O
hierarchy O
con- O
tains O
the O
lexical O
form O
of O
341 O
expressions. O
The O
sec- O
ond O
level O
categorizes O
these O
expressions O
by O
mean- O
ing. O
The O
remaining O
seven O
levels O
contain O
various O
forms O
for O
each O
expression O
where O
inser- O
tion/deletion O
of O
particles O
and O
other O
conjugations O
have O
been O
made. O
While O
this O
is O
the O
most O
compre- O
hensive O
dictionary O
of O
Japanese O
functional O
expres- O
sions, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
directly O
used O
for O
identiﬁca- O
tion O
because O
of O
the O
functional/content O
usage O
prob- O
lem O
described O
in O
the O
previous O
section. O
Therefore, O
identiﬁcation O
methods O
like O
Tsuchiya O
et O
al. O
(2006) O
which O
uses O
Support B-MethodName
Vector I-MethodName
Machines(SVM) I-MethodName
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
solve O
this O
problem. O
The O
data O
set O
(Tsuchiya O
et O
al., O
2005) O
used O
to O
train O
this O
method, O
called O
MUST, B-DatasetName
contains O
annotated O
instances O
of O
337 O
functional O
expressions. O
For O
each O
expression, O
a O
maximum O
of O
50 O
instances O
were O
collected O
from O
the O
1995 O
Mainichi O
newspaper O
corpus. O
Recent O
work O
by O
the O
same O
group O
of O
researchers O
(Nagasaka O
et O
al., O
2010) O
indicates O
that O
they O
have O
continued O
to O
annotate O
additional O
functional O
ex- O
pressions O
for O
the O
MUST B-DatasetName
data O
set. O
During O
this O
process, O
they O
have O
observed O
that O
only O
around O
one O
third O
of O
all O
functional O
expressions O
possess O
a O
suf- O
ﬁcient O
amount O
of O
functional O
and O

usages O
to O
be O
used O
with O
their O
machine O

method. O
However, O
they O
have O
yet O
to O
propose O
any O
method O
to O
cover O
the O
other O
two-thirds O
of O
functional O

Our O

to O

Identiﬁcation O
Method O
Our O
hybrid O
approach O
combines O
the O
results O
from O
two O
different O
methods O
of O
functional O
expression O
identiﬁcation. O
First, O
we O
will O
describe O
our O
imple- O
mentation O
of O
a O
method O
that O
uses O
machine O
learning. O
Then, O
we O
will O
describe O
our O
method O
of O
generating O
patterns O
for O
functional O
expressions.3.1 O
Machine O
Learning O
Our O
implementation O
of O
the O
method O
proposed O
by O
Tsuchiya O
et O
al. O
(2006) O
only O
deviates O
slightly O
from O
its O
original O
form. O
We O
developed O
our O
own O
SVM- B-MethodName
based O
text O
chunking O
system O
in O
Python O
while O
the O
original O
paper O
uses O
a O
text O
chunker O
called O
Yamcha1. O
We O
also O
use O
the O
MeCab2morphological O
analyzer O
with O
a O
dictionary O
called O
UniDic O
while O
the O
original O
paper O
used O
ChaSen O
with O
the O
default O
dictionary. O
When O
training O
the O
SVMs, B-MethodName
the O
original O
method O
uses O
three O
sets O
of O
labels: O
functional, O
content, O
and O
other. O
This O
allows O
both O
functional O
and O
content O
us- O
ages O
to O
be O
explicitly O
identiﬁed. O
However, O
in O
our O
application, O
we O
only O
need O
to O
identify B-TaskName
functional I-TaskName
usages I-TaskName
so O
that O
the O
expressions’ O
correct O
deﬁnitions O
can O
be O
displayed. O
Therefore, O
in O
our O
implementa- O
tion O
we O
only O
use O
two O
sets O
of O
labels O
(functional O
and O
other) O
and O
label O
all O
content O
usages O
as O
other. O
We O
also O
decided O
to O
build O
a O
separate O
model O
for O
each O
functional O
expression O
because O
it O
enables O
us O
to O
add O
new O
training O
data O
and O
functional O
expressions O
with- O
out O
having O
to O
retrain O
everything. O
Although O
this O
does O
increase O
time O
complexity O
in O
the O
worse O
case, O
in O
practice O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
big O
affect O
on O
perfor- O
mance O
because O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
the O
total O
number O
of O
models O
are O
being O
used O
for O
a O
given O
text. O
Identiﬁcation O
of O
functional O

in O
a O
new O
text O
is O
performed O
in O
the O
following O
steps: O

generate O

to O
identify B-TaskName

As O

this O

we O
have O
selected O

func- O

from O
Tsutsuji’s O
top O

as O
can- O
didates O
for O

We O
also O
included O
various O
surface O

of O
these O

from O
other O

of O

resulting O
in O
a O

To O

the O

we O
compared O
the O

of O
our O

with O
the O
coverage O
of O
just O
the O

We O
deﬁne O

as O
the O
ratio O
of O
functional O
expressions O
contained O
in O
both O
the O
Tsutsuji O

and O
BCCWJ O
that O

We O
ﬁrst O
collected O
all O
of O
the O

contained O
in O

We O
ex- O
cluded O
all O
of O
the O
single O
character O
surface O
forms O
which O
are O
mostly O
simple O

Next, O
we O
recorded O
the O
frequency O
of O
each O
surface O
form’s O
string O
in O
the O

Overlapping O
of O

is O
allowed O
as O
long O
as O
a O
string O
covers O
at O
least O
one O
character O
that O
no O
other O
string O
does. O
Finally, O
we O
recorded O
which O
surface O

were O
supported O
by O
our O
hybrid O
approach O
and O
the O
MUST B-DatasetName

that O

ing I-MetricName
around O
12% B-MetricValue
of O

in O

The O

this O

Conclusion O
In O
this O
paper O
we O
presented O
a O
hybrid O
approach O
for O
identifying B-TaskName
Japanese I-TaskName
functional I-TaskName
expressions I-TaskName
and I-TaskName
its I-TaskName
application I-TaskName
in I-TaskName

We O
showed O
that O
a O
combination O
of O
machine O
learning O
and O
simple O
patterns O
can O
improve O
coverage O
while O
still O
maintaining O
the O
high O
level O
of O
performance O
necessary O
for O
our O
application. O
