Abstract  O
In  O
this  O
paper,  O
we  O
describe  O
a  O
Chinese  O

and  O

1.  O
The  O
main  O
task  O
of  O
the  O
Bakeoff  O
is  O
to  O
identify  O
different  O
persons  O
from  O
the  O
news  O
stories  O
that  O
contain  O
the  O
same  O
person-name  O
string.  O
Compared  O
to  O
the  O
traditional  O
methods,  O
two  O
additional  O
features  O
are  O
used  O
in  O
our  O
system:  O
1)  O
n-grams  O
co-occurred  O
with  O
target  O
name  O
string;  O
2)  O
Jumping  O
distance  O
among  O
the  O
n-grams.  O
On  O
the  O
basis,  O
we  O
propose  O
a  O
two-stage  B-MethodName
clustering  I-MethodName
algo-  I-MethodName
rithm  I-MethodName
to  O
improve  O
the  O
low  O

Our  O
Novel  O
Try  O
For  O
this  O
task,  O
we  O
propose  O
a  O
Jumping-Distance  B-MethodName
based  I-MethodName
n-gram  I-MethodName
model  I-MethodName
(abbr.  O
DJ  O
n-gram)  O
to  O
de-scribe  O
the  O
semantics  O
of  O
the  O
closest  O
contexts  O
of  O
the  O
target  O
person-name  O
strings.  O
The  O
generation  O
of  O
the  O
DJ  B-MethodName
n-gram  I-MethodName
model  I-MethodName
mainly  O
involves  O
two  O
steps.  O
First,  O
we  O
mine  O
the  O
Jumping  O
tree  O
for  O
the  O
target  O
string;  O
second,  O
we  O
give  O
the  O
statistical  O
description  O
of  O
the  O
tree.  O
z  O
Jumping  O
Tree  O
Given  O
a  O
target  O
string,  O
we  O
firstly  O
extract  O
the  O
sentence  O
where  O
it  O
locates  O
as  O
its  O
closest  O
context.  O
Then  O
we  O
segment  O
the  O
sentence  O
into  O
n-grams(Chen  O
et  O
al.  O
,2009)  O
(only  O
Bi-gram  O
and  O
Tri-gram  O
are  O
used  O
in  O
this  O
paper).  O
For  O
each  O
n-gram,  O
we  O
regard  O
it  O
as  O
the  O
beginning  O
of  O
a  O
jumping  O
jour-  O
ney.  O
And  O
the  O
places  O
where  O
we  O
jump  O
are  O
the  O
sen-  O
tences  O
which  O
involve  O
the  O
n-gram.  O
By  O
the  O
same  O
way,  O
we  O
segment  O
the  O
sentences  O
into  O
n-grams  O
which  O
will  O
be  O
regarded  O
as  O
the  O
new  O
beginnings  O
to  O
open  O
further  O
jumping.  O
The  O
procedure  O
will  O
run  O
iteratively  O
until  O
there  O
are  O
no  O
sentences  O
in  O
the  O
document  O
(viz.  O
the  O
document  O
which  O
involves  O
the  O
target  O
string)  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
to  O
jump.  O
Actually,  O
we  O
find  O
there  O
are  O
only  O
3  O
jumps  O
in  O
average  O
in  O
our  O
previous  O
test  O
and  O
simultaneously  O
11  O
sentences  O
in  O
a  O
document  O
can  O
be  O
involved  O
into  O
the  O
jumping  O
journey.  O
Thus,  O
we  O
can  O
obtain  O
a  O
Jumping  O
Tree  O
where  O
each  O
jumping  O
route  O
from  O
the  O
initially  O
n-  O
gram  O
(viz.  O
the  O
gram  O
in  O
the  O
closes  O
context)  O
refer  O
to  O
a  O
branch.  O
And  O
for  O
each  O
intermediate  O
node,  O
its  O
child-nodes  O
are  O
the  O
n-grams  O
co-occurred  O
with  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
same  O
sentences.  O
The  O
motivation  O
to  O
generate  O
the  O
Jumping  O
Tree  O
is  O
to  O
imitate  O
the  O
thinking  O
model  O
of  O
human  O
rec-ognizing  O
the  O
word  O
senses  O
and  O
semantics.  O
In  O
de-tail,  O
for  O
each  O
intermediate  O
node  O
of  O
the  O
tree,  O
its  O
child-nodes  O
all  O
come  O
from  O
its  O
closest  O
contexts,  O
especially  O
the  O
nodes  O
co-occur  O
with  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
same  O
sentences  O
which  O
involve  O
the  O
real  O
grammar  O
and  O
semantic  O
relations.  O
Thus  O
the  O
child-nodes  O
normally  O
provide  O
the  O
natural  O
inference  O
for  O
its  O
word  O
sense.  O
For  O
example,  O
given  O
the  O
string  O
“SARS”,  O
we  O
can  O
deduce  O
its  O
sense  O
from  O
its  O
child  O
nodes  O
“Severe”,  O
“Acute”,  O
“Respiratory”  O
and  O
“Syndromes”  O
even  O
if  O
we  O
see  O
the  O
string  O
for  O
the  O
first  O
time.  O
On  O
the  O
basis,  O
the  O
procedure  O
of  O
infer-ence  O
run  O
iteratively,  O
that  O
is,  O
the  O
tree  O
always  O
use  O
the  O
child  O
nodes  O
deduce  O
the  O
meaning  O
of  O
their  O
fa-ther  O
nodes  O
then  O
further  O
ancestor  O
nodes  O
until  O
the  O
root.  O
Thus  O
the  O
tree  O
acts  O
as  O
a  O
hierarchical  O
under-  O
standing  O
procedure.  O
Additionally,  O
the  O
distances  O
among  O
nodes  O
in  O
the  O
tree  O
give  O
the  O
degree  O
of  O
se-mantic  O
relation.  O
In  O
the  O
task  O
of  O
person-name  B-TaskName
disambiguation,  I-TaskName
we  O
use  O
the  O
Jumping  O
Tree  O
to  O
deduce  O
the  O
identi-  O
ties  O
and  O
backgrounds  O
of  O
a  O
person.  O
Each  O
branch  O
of  O
the  O
tree  O
refers  O
to  O
a  O
property  O
of  O
the  O
person.  O

can  O

Systems  O
For  O
the  O
task  O
of  O
Chinese  O
person  B-TaskName
name  I-TaskName
disam-  I-TaskName
biguation,  I-TaskName
we  O
submitted  O
two  O
systems  O
as  O
follows:  O
z  O
System1  O
The  O
system  O
involves  O
two  O
main  O
components:  O
DJ-based  O
name  O
Identification  O
error  O
detection  O
and  O
DJ-based  O
person  B-TaskName
name  I-TaskName
disambiguation.  I-TaskName
The  O
first  O
component,  O
viz.  O
DJ-based  O
name  O
segmentation  O
error  O
detection,  O
aims  O
to  O
distin-guish  O
the  O
target  O
string  O
referring  O
to  O
person  O
name  O
from  O
that  O
referring  O
to  O
something  O
else.  O
Such  O
as,  O
the  O
string  O
“  O
咘⍋  O
”  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
person  O
name  O
“Hai  O
Huang”  O
but  O
also  O
a  O
name  O
of  O
sea  O
“the  O
Yellow  O
Sea”.  O
And  O
the  O
detection  O
component  O
focuses  O
on  O
obtaining  O
the  O
pure  O
person  O
name  O
“Hai  O
Huang”.  O
The  O
detection  O
component  O
firstly  O
establish  O
two  O
classes  O
of  O
features  O
which  O
respectively  O
describe  O
the  O
nature  O
of  O
human  O
and  O
that  O
of  O
things.  O
Such  O
as,  O
the  O
features  O
“professor”,  O
“research”,  O
“honest”  O
et  O
al.,  O
can  O
roughly  O
be  O
determined  O
as  O
the  O
nature  O
of  O
human,  O
and  O
conversely  O
the  O
features  O
“solid”,  O
“collapse”,  O
“deep”  O
et  O
al.,  O
can  O
be  O
that  O
of  O
things.  O
For  O
obtaining  O
the  O
features,  O
we  O
extract  O
10,000  O
documents  O
that  O
discuss  O
person,  O
eg.  O
“Albert  O
Ein-stein”  O
and  O
6000  O
documents  O
that  O
discuss  O
tech-  O
nology,  O
science,  O
geography,  O
et.al.,  O
from  O
Wikipedia  B-DatasetName
2.  O
For  O
each  O
document,  O
we  O
generate  O
its  O
Jumping  O
Tree,  O
and  O
regard  O
the  O
nodes  O
in  O
the  O
tree  O
as  O
the  O
features.  O
After  O
that,  O
we  O
combine  O
the  O
weights  O
of  O
the  O
same  O
features  O
and  O
normalized  O
the  O
value  O
by  O
dividing  O
that  O
by  O
the  O
average  O
weight  O
in  O
the  O
specific  O
class  O
of  O
features.  O
Based  O
on  O
the  O
two  O
classes  O
of  O
features,  O
given  O
a  O
target  O
string  O
and  O
the  O
document  O
where  O
it  O
occurs,  O
the  O
detection  O
component  O
firstly  O
generate  O
the  O
Jumping  O
Tree  O
of  O
the  O
document,  O
and  O
then  O
deter-  O
mines  O
whether  O
the  O
string  O
is  O
person  O
name  O
or  O
things  O
by  O
measuring  O
the  O
similarity  O
of  O
the  O
tree  O
to  O
the  O
classes  O
of  O
features.  O
Here,  O
we  O
simply  O
use  O
the  O
VSM  O
and  O
Cosine  O
metric  O
ΰBagga  O
and  O
Baldwin,  O
1998α  O
to  O
obtain  O
the  O
similarity.  O
The  O
second  O
component,  O
viz.  O
DJ-based  O
person  B-TaskName
name  I-TaskName
disambiguation,  I-TaskName
firstly  O
generates  O
the  O
Jumping  O
trees  O
for  O
all  O
documents  O
that  O
involve  O
specific  O
person  O
name.  O
And  O
a  O
two-stage  O
cluster-ing  O
algorithm  O
is  O
adopted  O
to  O
divide  O
the  O
docu-ments  O
and  O
refer  O
each  O
cluster  O
to  O
a  O
person.  O
The  O
first  O
stage  O
of  O
the  O
algorithm  O
runs  O
a  O
strict  O
division  O
which  O
focuses  O
on  O
obtaining  O
high  O
precision.  O
The  O
second  O
stage  O
performs  O
a  O
soft  O
division  O
which  O
is  O
used  O
to  O
improve  O
recall.  B-MetricName
The  O
two-stage  O
clustering  O
algorithm  O
(Ikeda  O
et  O
al.,2009  O
)  O
initially  O
obtains  O
the  O
optimal  O
parameters  O
that  O
respectively  O
refer  O
to  O
the  O
maximum  O
precision  B-MetricName
and  O
recall  B-MetricName
based  O
on  O
training  O
data,  O
and  O
then  O
regards  O
a  O
statistical  O
tradeoff  O
as  O
the  O
final  O
value  O
of  O
the  O
parameters.  O
Here,  O
the  O
Af-finity  O
Propagation  O
clustering  O

(Frey  O
BJ  O
and  O
Dueck  O
D,  O
2007)  O
is  O
in  O
use.  O
z  O
System2  O
The  O
system  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
system1  O
except  O
that  O
it  O
additionally  O
involve  O
Named  O

(Artiles  O
et.al,2009B;  O
Popescu,O.  O
and  O

the  O
two-stage  O
cluster-ing  O
in  O
the  O
component  O
of  O
person  O
name  O
disam-biguation.  O
In  O
detail,  O
given  O
a  O
person  O
name  O
and  O
the  O
documents  O
that  O
it  O
occurs  O
in,  O
the  O
disambigua-  O
tion  O
component  O
of  O
System2  O
firstly  O
adopt  O
NER  O
CRF++  O
toolkit  O

provided  O
by  O
MSRA  O
to  O
identify  O
Named  O
Entities(Chen  O
et  O
al.,  O
2006)  O
that  O
involve  O
the  O
given  O
name  O
string,  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
entity  O
“  O
ᴢ催  O

(viz.  O
Gao-ming  O

in  O
English)  O
when  O
given  O
the  O
target  O
name  O
string  O
“  O
催ᯢ  O
”(viz.  O
Ming  O

in  O
English).  O
Thus  O
the  O
documents  O
can  O
be  O
roughly  O
divided  O
into  O
different  O
clusters  O
of  O
Named  O
Entities  O
without  O

errors.  O
After  O
that,  O
we  O
additionally  O
adopt  O
the  O
two-stage  O
clustering  O
algorithm  O
to  O
further  O
divide  O
each  O
cluster.  O
Thus  O
we  O
can  O
deal  O
with  O
the  O
issue  O
of  O

without  O

We  O
can  O
find  O
that  O

can  O
achieve  O
more  O

than  O

but  O
lower  O

Besides,  O
we  O
evaluate  O
the  O

Four  O

that  O

The  O

of  O
the  O

We  O
can  O
find  O
that  O
all  O
steps  O
achieve  O
poor  O
recall.  O
And  O
the  O
step  O
of  O

achieve  O
the  O
best  O
F-score  B-MetricName
although  O
it  O
don’t  O
involve  O

That  O
is  O
because  O
NER  O
is  O
helpful  O
to  O
im-prove  O
precision  O
but  O
not  O
recall,  O
as  O
shown  O
in  O

Conversely,  O

The  O

This  O

also  O

The  O

We  O
can  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
F-scores  B-MetricName
both  O
have  O
been  O
improved  O
substantially.  O
And  O
the  O
two  O
steps  O
still  O
maintain  O
the  O
original  O
distribution  O
be-  O
tween  O

That  O
is,  O
the  O
DJ  O

which  O
has  O

on  O

still  O

And  O
NER  O
2+DJ_2  O
also  O
main-  O
tains  O
higher  O

This  O
illustrates  O
that  O
the  O

has  O
no  O
ability  O
to  O
remedy  O
the  O
short-comings  O
of  O

In  O
this  O

we  O
report  O
a  O
hybrid  O

system  O
and  O
a  O

rithm  O
for  O
extract  O
useful  O
global  O
n-gram  O
features  O
from  O
the  O
context  O
.Experiment  O
showed  O
that  O
our  O
algorithm  O
performed  O
high  O
precision  O
and  O
poor  O
recall.  O
Furthermore,  O
two-stage  O
clustering  O
can  O
handl  O
a  O
change  O
in  O
the  O
one-stage  O
clustering  O
algo-  O
rithm,  O
especially  O
for  O
recall  O
score.  O
In  O
the  O
future,  O
we  O
will  O
investigate  O
global  O
new  O
types  O
of  O
features  O
to  O
improve  O
the  O
recall  O
score  O
and  O
local  O
new  O
types  O
of  O
features  O
to  O
improve  O
the  O
precision  O
score.  O
For  O
instance,  O
the  O
location  O
and  O
organization  O
besides  O
the  O
person  O
in  O
the  O
named-entities.  O
And  O
we  O
try  O
to  O
use  O
