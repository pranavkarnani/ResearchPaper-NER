Introduction O
In O
our O
daily O
speech, O
we O
frequently O
make O
use O
of O
colors O
in O
order O
to O
increase O
our O
expressiveness O
by O
invoking O
different O
emotions. O
For O
instance, O
we O
usu- O
ally O
stress O
the O
redness O
of O
someone’s O
face O
for O
the O
implication O
of O
his/her O
anger O
or O
excitement, O
or O
we O
use O
phrases O
including O
the O
color O
black O
to O
refer O
to O
a O
depressed O
mood. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
color O
pink O
is O
mostly O
used O
with O
positive O
connotations O
such O
as O
‘to O
see O
everything O
in O
pink O
light’, O
where O
the O
mean- O
ing O
is O
related O
to O
optimism O
and O
happiness. O
Actually, O
the O
parts O
of O
the O
nervous O
system O
which O
are O
responsible O
for O
emotional O
arousal O
are O
affectedas O
soon O
as O
a O
color O
is O
perceived. O
Thus, O
the O
term O
color O
emotion O
has O
lately O
been O
used O
to O
represent O
the O
emotions O
arousing O
in O
human O
beings O
when O
they O
percept O
a O
color O
(Xin O
et O
al., O
2004). O
The O
correlation O
of O
color O
and O
emotion O
has O
been O
the O
focus O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
psycholinguistic O
studies O
so O
far. O
In O
the O
experiments O
conducted O
by O
these O
studies, O
subjects O
have O
usually O
been O
asked O
to O
indicate O
their O
emotional O
responses O
to O
different O
colors O
so O
that O
some O
general O
results O
stating O
which O
color O
arouses O
what O
kind O
of O
emotion O
could O
be O
obtained. O
Sensing O
emotion, O
or O
in O
other O
words, O
affective O
sensing O
in O
text O
by O
using O
Natural O
Language O
Pro- O
cessing O
(NLP) O
techniques O
is O
recently O
a O
very O
pop- O
ular O
topic O
in O
computational O
linguistics. O
There O
ex- O
ist O
several O
studies O
focusing O
on O
the O
automatic O
iden- O
tiﬁcation O
of O
emotions O
in O
text O
with O
the O
help O
of O
both O
knowledge-based O
and O
corpus-based O
methods. O
Thus O
it O
is O
conceivable O
to O
explore O
whether O
state-of- O
the-art O
corpus O
analysis O
techniques O
can O
give O
sup- O
port O
to O
psycholinguistic O
experiments. O
Considering O
that O
psycholinguistic O
experiments O
are O
very O
costly O
since O
a O
lot O
of O
resources O
are O
required O
for O
both O
the O
setup O
and O
evaluation O
phases, O
employ- O
ing O
a O
corpus-based O
approach O
for O
affective O
sensing O
could O
be O
much O
more O
efﬁcient O
for O
all O
analysis O
to O
be O
held O
in O
the O
future, O
if O
this O
technique O
was O
proven O
to O
give O
reasonable O
results. O
In O
this O
paper, O
we O
employ O
a O
semantic B-TaskName
similarity I-TaskName
mechanism O
automatically O
obtained O
in O
an O
unsuper- O
vised O
way O
from O
a O
large O
corpus O
of O
texts O
in O
order O
to O
check O
the O
similarity O
of O
color O
and O
emotion O
via O
computational O
analysis O
methods. O
We O
adopt O
the O
psycholinguistic O
experiments O
as O
references, O
with O
which O
we O
compare O
our O
results O
to O
ﬁnd O
out O
if O
there O
is O
a O
correlation O
between O
the O
two O
approaches.28The O
paper O
is O
organized O
as O
follows. O
In O
Section O
2, O
we O
introduce O
some O
related O
work O
focusing O
on O
the O
association O
of O
color O
and O
emotion O
only O
from O
a O
psycholinguistic O
point O
of O
view, O
since O
this O
topic O
has O
not O
been O
addressed O
by O
computational O
analysis O
techniques O
so O
far. O
In O
Section O
3, O
we O
describe O
the O
methodology O
for O
implementing O
a O
similarity B-TaskName
be- I-TaskName
tween I-TaskName
colors I-TaskName
and I-TaskName
emotions, I-TaskName
in O
particular O
how O
to O
represent O
an O
emotion O
in O
a O
latent O
semantic O
space. O
We O
present O
the O
evaluation O
of O
our O
approach O
and O
make O
a O
comparison O
with O
the O
results O
of O
psycholin- O
guistic O
experiments O
in O
Section O

Lastly, O
we O
report O
the O
conclusions O
and O
possible O

Background O
As O
we O
mentioned O
previously, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
con- O
siderable O
interest O
in O
the O
psycholinguistic O
research O
area O
addressing O
the O
impact O
of O
color O
on O
emotions. O
(Zentner, O
2001) O
mainly O
addressed O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
young O
children O
could O
show O
reliable O
color O
preferences. O
This O
study O
also O
tried O
to O
make O
a O
comparison O
with O
the O
results O
obtained O
with O
adults O
and O
older O
children. O
Subjects’ O
color O
preferences O
were O
obtained O
by O
asking O
them O
to O
choose O
the O
one O
that O
they O
prefer O
among O
an O
array O
of O
colored O
card- O
board O
rectangles. O
As O
an O
alternative O
way O
to O
repre- O
sent O
musical O
information O
for O
providing O
feedback O
on O
emotion O
expression O
in O
music, O
(Bresin, O
2005) O
suggested O
to O
use O
a O
graphical O
non-verbal O
represen- O
tation O
of O
expressivity O
in O
music O
performance O
by O
ex- O
ploiting O
color O
as O
an O
index O
of O
emotion. O
And O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
determining O
which O
colors O
were O
most O
suitable O
for O
an O
emotional O
expression, O
some O
ex- O
periments O
were O
conducted, O
where O
subjects O
rated O
how O
well O
several O
colors O
and O
their O
nuances O
corre- O
sponded O
to O
music O
performances O
expressing O
differ- O
ent O
emotions. O
(Kaya, O
2004) O
tried O
to O
investigate O
and O
discuss O
the O
associations O
between O
color O
and O
emotion O
by O
conducting O
experiments O
where O
college O
students O
were O
asked O
to O
indicate O
their O
emotional O
re- O
sponses O
to O
principal, O
intermediate O
and O
achromatic O
colors, O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
their O
choices. O
There O
exist O
also O
some O
research O
investigating O
whether O
the O
color O
perception O
is O
related O
to O
the O
re- O
gion O
of O
the O
subject. O
For O
instance, O
(Gao O
et O
al., O
2007) O
analyzed O
and O
compared O
the O
color O
emotions O
of O
people O
from O
seven O
regions O
in O
a O
psychophysicalexperiment, O
with O
an O
attempt O
to O
clarify O
the O
inﬂu- O
ences O
of O
culture O
and O
color O
perception O
attributes O
on O
color O
emotions. O
This O
study O
suggested O
that O
it O
might O
be O
possible O
to O
compose O
a O
color O
emotion O
space O
by O
using O
a O
restricted O
number O
of O
factors. O
As O
for O
(So- O
riano O
and O
Valenzuela, O
2009), O
this O
study O
tried O
to O
ﬁnd O
out O
why O
there O
was O
often O
a O
relationship O
be- O
tween O
color O
and O
emotion O
words O
in O
different O
lan- O
guages. O
In O
order O
to O
achieve O
this, O
a O
new O
experi- O
mental O
methodology O
called O
the O
Implicit O
Associa- O
tion O
Test O
(IAT) O
was O
used O
to O
explore O
the O
implicit O
connotative O
structure O
of O
the O
Peninsular O
Spanish O
color O
terms O
in O
terms O
of O
Osgood’s O
universal O
se- O
mantic O
dimensions O
explained O
in O
(Adams O
and O
Os- O
good, O
1973). O
The O
research O
conducted O
by O
(Xin O
et O
al., O
2004) O
tried O
to O
compare O
the O
color O
emotional O
re- O
sponses O
that O
were O
obtained O
by O
conducting O
visual O
experiments O
in O
different O
regions O
by O
using O
a O
set O
of O
color O
samples. O
A O
quantitative O
approach O
was O
used O
in O
this O
study O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
compare O
the O
color O
emotions O
among O
these O
regions. O
(Madden O
et O
al., O
2000) O
focused O
on O
the O
possible O
power O
of O
color O
for O
creating O
and O
sustaining O
brand O
and O
corporate O
im- O
ages O
in O
international O
marketing. O
This O
study O
tried O
to O
explore O
the O
favorite O
colors O
of O
consumers O
from O
different O
countries, O
the O
meanings O
they O
associated O
with O
colors, O
and O
their O
color O
preferences O
for O
a O
logo. O
The O
study O
that O
we O
will O
use O
for O
evaluating O
our O
re- O
sults O
is O
a O
work O
which O
focused O
on O
the O
topic O
“emo- O
tional O
responses O
to O
color O
used O
in O
advertisement” O
(Alt, O
2008). O
During O
the O
experiments, O
this O
study O
conducted O
a O
survey O
where O
the O
subjects O
were O
re- O
quired O
to O
view O
an O
advertisement O
with O
a O
dominant O
color O
hue, O
and O
then O
select O
a O
speciﬁc O
emotional O
re- O
sponse O
and O
a O
positive/negative O
orientation O
related O
with O
this O
color. O
More O
than O
150 O
subjects O
partici- O
pated O
in O
this O
study, O
roughly O
equally O
partitioned O
in O
gender. O
There O
are O
two O
main O
reasons O
why O
we O
pre- O
ferred O
to O
use O
this O
study O
for O
our O
evaluation O
proce- O
dure. O
Firstly, O
the O
presentation O
and O
organization O
of O
the O
results O
provide O
a O
good O
reference O
for O
our O
own O
experiments. O
In O
addition, O
it O
focusses O
on O
adver- O
tisement, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
applicative O
ﬁelds O
we O
want O
to O
address O
in O
future O
work. O
3 O
Methodology O
Sensing O
emotions O
from O
text O
is O
an O
appealing O
task O
of O
natural O
language O
processing O
(Pang O
and O
Lee,292008; O
Strapparava O
and O
Mihalcea, O
2007): O
the O
au- O
tomatic O
recognition O
of O
affective O
states O
is O
becom- O
ing O
a O
fundamental O
issue O
in O
several O
domains O
such O
as O
human-computer O
interaction O
or O
sentiment O
anal- O
ysis O
for O
opinion O
mining. O
Indeed, O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
textual O
material O
has O
become O
available O
form O
the O
Web O
(e.g. O
blogs, O
forums, O
social O
networks), O
rais- O
ing O
the O
attractiveness O
of O
empirical O
methods O
analy- O
sis O
on O
this O
ﬁeld. O
For O
representing O
the O
emotions, O
we O
exploit O
the O
methodology O
described O
in O
(Strapparava O
and O
Mi- O
halcea, O
2008). O
The O
idea O
underlying O
the O
method O
is O
the O
distinction O
between O
direct O
andindirect O
affec- O
tive O
words. O
For O
direct O
affective O
words O
(i.e. O
words O
that O
di- O
rectly O
denote O
emotions), O
authors O
refer O
to O
the O
WORDNETAFFECT B-DatasetName
(Strapparava O
and O
Valitutti, O
2004) O
lexicon, O
a O
freely O
available O
extension O
of O
the O
WORDNETdatabase O
which O
employs O
some O
basic O
emotion O
labels O
(e.g. O
anger, O
disgust, O
fear, O
joy, O
sad- O
ness) O
to O
annotate O
W O
ORDNETsynsets. O
For O
indirect O
affective O
words, O
a O
crucial O
aspect O
is O
building O
a O
mechanism O
to O
represent O
an O
emotion O
starting O
from O
affective O
lexical O
concepts O
and O
to O
in- O
troduce O
a O
semantic O
similarity O
among O
generic O
terms O
(and O
hence O
also O
words O
denoting O
colors) O
and O
these O
emotion O
representations. O
Latent B-TaskName
Semantic I-TaskName
Analysis I-TaskName
is O
used O
to O
acquire, O
in O
an O
unsupervised O
setting, O
a O
vector O
space O
from O
the O
British O
National O
Corpus1. O
In O
LSA, O
term O
co- O
occurrences O
in O
a O
corpus O
are O
captured O
by O
means O
of O
a O
dimensionality O
reduction O
operated O
by O
a O
singu- O
lar O
value O
decomposition O
on O
the O
term-by-document O
matrix O
representing O
the O
corpus. O
LSA O
has O
the O
advantage O
of O
allowing O
homogeneous O
representa- O
tion O
and O
comparison O
of O
words, O
word O
sets O
(e.g. O
synsets), O
text O
fragments O
or O
entire O
documents. O
For O
representing O
word O
sets O
and O
texts O
by O
means O
of O
a O
LSA O
vector, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
use O
a O
variation O
of O
thepseudo-document O
methodology O
described O
in O
(Berry, O
1992). O
This O
variation O
takes O
into O
account O
also O
a O
tf-idf O
weighting B-HyperparameterName
schema. O
In O
practice, O
each O
document O
can O
be O
represented O
in O
the O
LSA O
space O
by O
summing O
up O
the O
normalized O
LSA O
vectors O
of O
all O
the O
1BNC O
is O
a O
very O
large O
(over O
100 O
million O
words) O
cor- O
pus O
of O
modern O
English, O
both O
spoken O
and O
written O
(see O
http://www.hcu.ox.ac.uk/bnc/). O
Other O
more O
spe- O
ciﬁc O
corpora O
could O
also O
be O
considered, O
to O
obtain O
a O
more O
do- O
main O
oriented O
similarity.terms O
contained O
in O
it. O
Therefore O
a O
set O
of O
words O
(and O
even O
all O
the O
words O
labeled O
with O
a O
particular O
emotion) O
can O
be O
represented O
in O
the O
LSA O
space, O
performing O
the O
pseudo-document O
technique O
on O
them. O
As O
stated O
in O
(Strapparava O
and O
Mihalcea, O
2008), O
each O
emotion O
can O
be O
represented O
in O
various O
ways O
in O
the O
LSA O
space. O
The O
particular O
one O
that O
we O
are O
employing O
is O
the O
‘LSA O
Emotion O
Synset’ O
setting, O
which O
has O
proved O
to O
give O
the O
best O
results O
in O
terms O
of O
ﬁne-grained O
emotion O
sensing. O
In O
this O
setting, O
the O
synsets O
of O
direct O
emotion O
words, O
taken O
form O
WORDNETAFFECT B-DatasetName
, O
are O
considered. O
For O
our O
purposes, O
we O
compare O
the O
similarities O
among O
the O
representations O
of O
colors O
and O
emotions O
in O
the O
latent O
similarity O
space. O

To O
compare O
our O

with O
the O

we O
represent O
the O

3. O
We O
can O
observe O
that O
the O
global O
correlation O
is O
rather O
good O
(0.75). O
In O
particular, O
it O
is O
very O
high30Color O
The O
results O
are O
good O
for O
Blue O
and O
Yellow O
as O
well, O
while O
the O
correlation O
is O
not O
so O
high O
for O
Red. O
This O
could O
suggest O
that O
Red O
is O
a O
quite O
ambiguous O
color O
with O
respect O
to O
emotions. O

Conclusions O
There O
are O
emotional O
and O
symbolic O
associations O
with O
different O
colors. O
This O
is O
also O
revealed O
in O
our O
daily O
use O
of O
language, O
as O
we O
frequently O
make O
ref- O
erences O
to O
colors O
for O
increasing O
our O
expressiveness O
by O
invoking O
different O
emotions. O
While O
most O
of O
the O
research O
conducted O
so O
far O
with O
the O
aim O
of O
an- O
alyzing O
the O
relationship O
between O
color O
and O
emo- O
tion O
was O
based O
on O
psycholinguistic O
experiments, O
the O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
exploring O
this O
associ- O
ation O
by O
employing O
a O
corpus-based O
approach O
for O
affective O
sensing. O
In O
order O
to O
show O
that O
our O
approach O
was O
provid- O
ing O
reasonable O
results, O
we O
adopted O
one O
of O
the O
ex- O
isting O
psycholinguistic O
experiments O
as O
a O
reference. O
Following O
that O
adoption, O
we O
made O
a O
comparison O
between O
the O
results O
of O
this O
research O
and O
our O
own O
technique. O
Since O
we O
have O
observed O
that O
these O
two O
results O
were O
highly O
correlated O
as O
we O
expected, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
explore O
further O
this O
direction. O
Cer-tainly O
different O
cultures O
can O
play O
a O
role O
for O
variant O
emotional O
responses O
(Adams O
and O
Osgood, O
1973). O
Thus, O
as O
a O
next O
step, O
we O
are O
planning O
to O
investi- O
gate O
how O
the O
perception O
of O
color O
by O
human O
be- O
ings O
varies O
in O
different O
languages O
by O
again O
con- O
ducting O
a O
computational O
analysis O
with O
NLP O
tech- O
niques. O
Employing O
this O
approach O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
and O
efﬁcient O
for O
the O
design O
of O
applications O
related O
to O
the O
ﬁelds O
of O
multimedia, O
automatic O
ad- O
vertisement O
production, O
marketing O
and O
education O
(e.g. O
e-learning O
environments) O
In O
addition, O
based O
on O
our O
exploration O
about O
the O
color O
perception O
of O
emotions O
from O
a O
corpus-based O
point O
of O
view, O
we O
suggest O
that O
“visual” O
informa- O
tion O
regarding O
objects O
and O
events O
could O
be O
ex- O
tracted O
from O
large O
amounts O
of O
text, O
using O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
techniques O
proposed O
in O
the O
present O
paper. O
This O
information O
can O
be O
easily O
exploited O
for O
cre- O
ation O
of O
dictionaries O
or O
used O
in O
dynamic O
visualiza- O
tion O
of O
text O
such O
as O
kinetic O
typography O
(Strappar- O
ava O
et O
al., O
2007). O
As O
a O
concrete O
example, O
our O
ap- O
proach O
can O
be O
extended O
to O
discover O
the O
association O
of O
colors O
not O
only O
with O
emotions, O
but O
also O
with O
in- O
direct O
affective O
words O
in O
various O
languages. O
We O
believe O
that O
the O
discovery O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
relation- O
ship O
would O
allow O
us O
to O
automatically O
build O
col- O
orful O
dictionaries, O
which O
could O
substantially O
help O
users O
with O
both O
interpretation O
and O
memorization O
processes. O
